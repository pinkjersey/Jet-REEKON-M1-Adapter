# Jet Miter Saw Adapter for REEKON M1 Caliber

A simple 3D-printable adapter that allows the REEKON M1 Caliber measuring tool to work with Jet miter saws.

## Why I Made This

The REEKON M1 Caliber is a great tool that digitally measures material as you slide it under the saw, but it doesn't mount directly to my Jet miter saw fence. This adapter solves that problem.

## How to Use

1. Print the STL file
2. Pull the top part of your miter saw fence to the left, attach using one screw. I added a few washers to ensure the screw didn't go through the adapter.
3. Clamp the REEKON M1 Caliber to the adapter
4. Calibrate the M1 as usual

That's it! No special tricks needed.
